## Hi, I'm Theo!ðŸ‘‹

Brazilian Dev who loves to code and design applications.

```typescript
class Theo extends Person {
  public nick = '0x0th30';
  public lovesCoffee = true;
  public langs = ['typescript', 'javascript', 'python', 'sql'];
  public devops = ['github actions', 'docker', 'k8s', 'linux'];
  public interests = ['secure development', 'application architecture', 'microservices'];
  public hobbies = ['martial arts', 'ctf', 'coding'];
  public codingSince = new Date('2018');
}
```

I had started to work as Backend Developer when I'm 16, since this point I had focused my efforts to study how to design secure and scalable applications and how to improve my code quality. Navigating through themes like CI/CD pipelines, Owasp TOP 10, microservices architecture, and thousands of others I consider myself an eternal learner.
